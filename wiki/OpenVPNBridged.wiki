= OpenVPN in bridged mode =
Here you'll see how to use the pre-configured openvpn server to provide a *client to site* vpn in *bridged mode*.
 * *client to site* - when one or more single remote hosts can connect to a LAN
 * *bridge mode* - when the local and remote hosts act similar as they are in the same local network.

== SERVER ==
=== turning bridge server on ===
{{{
remountrw
cd /ro/etc/openvpn/
mv udp-bridge.conf.OFF udp-bridge.conf
remountro
/etc/init.d/openvpn restart
}}}
add the line on firewall rules at /ro/etc/firewall/alix.fw
{{{
/sbin/iptables -A INPUT -p udp --dport 1194 -m state --state NEW -j ACCEPT
}}}

_bridged and routed can be used simultaneously, just change the port (1194) on one of them_
=== creating client certificates ===
{{{
remountrw
cd /ro/etc/ssl/easy-rsa/
. ./vars
./build-key client1.site
./build-key client2.site
remountro
}}}

_client1.site.crt, client1.site.key, client2.site.crt and client2.site.key are created under /etc/ssl/easy-rsa/keys/ and they are used on clients_

== configuring Windows clients ==
=== download and install openvpn ===
 * http://openvpn.net/index.php/download/community-downloads.html
 * http://swupdate.openvpn.org/community/releases/openvpn-2.2.2-install.exe

=== config files and certificates ===
* Path for files on Win 7 64bits
{{{
C:\Program Files (x86)\OpenVPN\config\office-bridge.ovpn
C:\Program Files (x86)\OpenVPN\config\keys\ca.crt
C:\Program Files (x86)\OpenVPN\config\keys\client.crt
C:\Program Files (x86)\OpenVPN\config\keys\client.key
}}}

*office-bridge.ovpn* content
{{{

*ca.crt*, *client.crt* and *client.key* content need to be copied from /etc/ssl/easy-rsa/keys/ on server.
