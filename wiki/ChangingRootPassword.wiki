It´ll designed to most common operations, just a couple functions were available under login *admin* and password *123456*

Encrypt a new *secret*
{{{
perl -le 'print crypt("your-text-clear-password", "salt-hash")'
}}}

Get encrypted string and paste into file */var/www/.htpasswd*
{{{
admin:sasQBhz6TYPA2

{{{
perl -le 'print crypt("new-guest-password", "salt-hash")'
}}}

Get encrypted string and paste into file */var/www/.htpasswd-storage*
{{{
guest:sadZcJuXa3yRc
}}}

Edit */etc/nginx/conf.d/alix.conf* and remove *#* from *auth_basic* and *auth_basic_user_file* inside first server block.
{{{
server {
    listen       80;
    server_name  $hostname;

    location / {
        root /mnt/;
        autoindex on;
        autoindex_localtime on;

        auth_basic "Restrited Access";
        auth_basic_user_file /var/www/.htpasswd-storage;
    }
}

server {
    listen       443;

Default password for *guest* user is *123456*, change it running *smbpasswd -a nobody*

After that, restart samba service: */etc/init.d/samba restart*

_If you intend to persist this, the changed files are */etc/samba/smb.conf* and */etc/samba/private/passdb.tdb*, move them from */rw* to */ro*_
